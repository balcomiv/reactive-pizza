## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Notes for 'steps taken' (will be using for gitbook etc.)

### Create page module (page modules === routed pages)

- ng g m pizza

### Set up folder structure (CLI can do this too, but approach may help conceptualize design prior to making components etc.)

- TODO: Show folder structure
